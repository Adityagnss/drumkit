# drumkit
Create a drum kit using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and Advanced JavaScript for DOM Manipulation, dynamically generating clickable drum pads. Attach event listeners to respond to clicks, triggering a function to play corresponding sounds. Enhance user experience by seamlessly integrating sound files with instrument buttons, resulting in an interactive and visually appealing drum kit on your webpage.


1. Define an object `instruments` mapping instrument names to sound files.
2. Use `DOMContentLoaded` event to wait for the HTML to load.
3. Create drum pads dynamically in the DOM for each instrument.
4. Add a click event listener to each drum pad.
5. Define a function `playSound` to create and play an `Audio` object.
6. Load and append the script at the end of the HTML body.
7. Drum pads have a `drum-pad` class for styling.
8. Clicking a drum pad triggers the associated sound to play.
9. Customize by adding more instruments to the `instruments` object.
10. Style the drum pads using CSS for better presentation.
